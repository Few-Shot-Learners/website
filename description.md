I want to make a website.

Here are my preferences: It should be a very simple website, for a reading/learning group titled "Few Shot Learners".

Functionality:
- Homepage should have "Few Shot Learners" appear in the middle. The subtitle there should be "Deeply technical learnings about everything AI"
- Technical Writings
    - should be a fully functional blog type thing. this is the most important part, it should be a clean way to see the blogs. think anthropic.
- About tab
    - Quick blurb about being a research/learning focused group, basically want to understand things at the deepest level, implementing papers and things like that with no llm help
    - We had a good understanding of AI, but it wasn’t truly grounded in strong coding sessions - we could do research and work on complex ml systems but when it came to nitty gritties we were lacking and wanted to address that. if you asked a question verbally about any part of the transformer, we could answer, but knowledge wasnt strongest thing. like learning coding is something that simply just takes time and a lot of energy. And I think a lot of ppl in the ML space spend time on learning conceptual things but fail to comprehend the details that only come from implementationAnd like it’s not a new concept, implementing papers is like the most known thing
